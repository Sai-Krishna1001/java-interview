### 1. What is Amazon Web Services (AWS) and what are its key features?
AWS is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of on-demand services, including computing power, storage, and networking. Key features include:
- Scalability
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Security and compliance
- Global infrastructure
- Managed services

### 2. Explain the concept of Regions and Availability Zones in AWS.
AWS infrastructure is divided into:
- **Regions:** Geographical areas containing multiple data centers.
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Physically separate locations within a region that provide redundancy and fault tolerance.

### 3. What is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and how is it used?
An AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine template that includes an operating system and software. It is used to launch EC2 instances quickly and consistently.

### 4. Describe the difference between Elastic IP and Public IP in AWS.
- **Elastic IP:** A static, persistent IP address that can be reassigned to different instances.
- **Public IP:** A dynamically assigned IP address that changes when an instance is stopped and started.

### 5. What is the role of the AWS Management Console?
The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for managing AWS services, monitoring resources, and configuring security settings.

### 6. Explain the concept of Elastic Computing in AWS.
Elastic computing refers to the ability to scale computing resources up or down automatically based on demand, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### 7. What is AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and why is it important?
IAM is a security service that controls user access and permissions for AWS resources. It helps enforce least privilege access and enhances security.

### 8. Describe the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.
AWS follows a shared responsibility model where:
- **AWS is responsible** for security *of* the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, networking).
- **Customers are responsible** for security *in* the cloud (data protection, access management, configurations).

### 9. What is the difference between Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling in AWS?
- **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing instance size (CPU, RAM) to handle more load.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding more instances to distribute the load efficiently.

### 10. Explain the concept of High Availability in AWS.
High availability refers to designing systems that minimize downtime and ensure continuous operation through redundancy, load balancing, and failover mechanisms.
